			<p> We all want to do what's good for us, we all want a healthy body to get us through our hectic lifestyles. A simple form of moves and exercises related
				to the ancient martial arts in China, can accomplish this for you, if you are willing to spend 15 minutes a day working on these exercises.
				Tai chi is often described as <strong>"Meditation in Motion"</strong>, but it might well be called<strong> "Medication in Motion"</strong>. There is growing evidence that this mind-body practice,
				which originated in China as a martial art, has value in treating or preventing many health problems. And you can get started even if you aren't in good shape or in
				the best of health. It is believed that tai chi can delay aging and prolong life, increase flexibility, strengthen muscles and tendons, and aid in the treatment
				of heart disease, high blood pressure, arthritis, digestive disorders, skin diseases, depression, cancer, and many other illnesses. People of all ages benefit from
				tai chi because of the low impact, easy flowing movements, to help with back pain and balance, posture and a general feeling of wellbeing. Feel free to see all 
				the health benefits on our Health page .....<a href="health.html"> <font color="6600FF">Click Health</font></a>
